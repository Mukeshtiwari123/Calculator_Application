# Calculator_Application
Create a simple GUI-based calculator application in Java that can perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Steps Involve In this Project**

**1. User Interface:** Design a basic command-line interface that displays a menu of options
to the user, such as "Addition," "Subtraction," "Multiplication," "Division," and "Exit."

**2. Input Handling:** Implement a function that takes user input to select an operation from
the menu.

**3. Arithmetic Operations:** Create functions for performing addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division. These functions should take two numbers as input and return
the result.

**4. Input Numbers:** Implement a function to collect two numbers from the user as input for
the selected operation.

**5. Display Result:** Display the result of the arithmetic operation to the user.

**6. Error Handling:** Implement error handling to handle division by zero or invalid input
values.

**7. Documentation:** Document your code with comments, explaining the purpose of
functions and variables. Include user instructions on how to use the calculator
application.
